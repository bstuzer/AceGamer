For both of our wireframes we used *Figma*. Being influenced by the feedback from the interviews we've done for [Milestone 2](https://github.com/polito-hci-2021/AceGamerApp/blob/main/M2/Milestone2.md), the elements we have focused on while merging our ideas can be listed as:
- Simplifying the design, by letting the users simply select the game they want to play to start the process.
- *"A progression bar"* which helps the users to always know in which part of the entire process they are.
- A notification for the users to inform which component is the weakest one among their builds. The application can also show multiple components if they need replacement as well.
- Since most of the responders in our observation phase *(as seen on [Milestone 1](https://github.com/polito-hci-2021/AceGamerApp/blob/main/M1/Milestone1.md))* stated that price is the first thing they look for when doing a research for a component to buy; we put the price above other specifications, and placed it on "proposed component" grids.
- Since we decided to cancel filters to reduce redundancy earlier on [Milestone 2](https://github.com/polito-hci-2021/AceGamerApp/blob/main/M2/Milestone2.md), we are planning to designate those proposed component grids with expressive metrics such as "best price", "best value for money" or "best performance" to guide the users in an easy-to-understand manner. Rather than guiding them with a one dimensional rating, we wanted to let the users feel free to have a space to make decisions for themselves based on their personal preferences without having to comply with vague subjective measures or over-detailed filters that can be tedious for some users. 
- For the Summary Page where every path leads to, the users can be redirected to a shopping site for each component they have selected.

Therefore, for our second wireframe, we wanted to use a page that would be able to show most of the elements we've decided to implement.
