# AceGamerApp - Overview
AceGamerApp is a web application for anyone who wants to play a PC game that his/her current setup cannot run. With this application, we aimed to achieve an easy-to-use environment where they can easily find the components to acquire in order to upgrade their current setup, or to create the best fitting one from scratch. 

We've documented our project by following the steps called milestones as listed below:
1. Project Description and Needfinding
2. Prototyping and Heuristics
3. Wireframes
4. Usability Testing
